# Driver Tips

## Description
  Delivery Drivers, ever feel like something is wrong when you cash out, but you're not sure?
  Or worse, you know something is wrong, but you don't have any records?

  * This app allows you to easily track your tips.
  * It's designed for delivery drivers! Many apps track tips, but delivery drivers have different requirements such as banks and cashouts.
  * Keep notes.
  * Tracks income (for bookkeeping and taxes).
  * Export data. (Coming)

## Quick Examples
  Enter the order number, cash tip amout and / or the credit tip amount, the trip compensation amount, and payout amount if any.

 And the app keeps track of all the math for you. See your total deliveries, total tips, and tips excluding payout at the bottom.

Note: the app does *not* track your cash out amount! It tracks what you should have at the end of the night.

## Quick Start
Download from the App store

### Enter a delivery.
  * Click on `+New Delivery` to enter your delivery to enter a deliver to enter a delivery. *Note that fields with an asterisk are required.*

### Cashing out.
  * If you do find a mistake at the end of the night, do not be abusive! You still may be the one who made the mistake! Gently and kindly ask to look at the cash out report / screen and see if you can spot a misentered order, you need to be specific and helpful.  Being generally angry and abusive is **not** helping your cause!

  * Possible problems:
      * Missing / misentered tip amount (most common issue).
      * Unpaid 3rd party order (Eat24 says *Amount Due*)
      * Coupons marked as collected?
      * Bank received?
      * Order misassigned to another driver (rare).
      * Were orders changed after you were closed out. Your cashout needs to be reopened and closed out for changes to be effective.
      * If everything is else is good, unfortunately it's probably you! Mishandled cash is the most likely explanation.
        *  Did a customer ask for "change" for a large bill and not give you the larger bill?
         * Do you always keep your money in one spot?
